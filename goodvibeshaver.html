  <p2>I wanted this to serve as a combination of an "About me"-page, and blog of sorts. </p2>	
  <p3>I'm not particularly special and don't warrant any sort of interest, but I thought it'd be fun. Also, RIP Emil.</p3>

<h2>Second Entry</h2>
<p1>As of 30th of January, 2025 -- I have yet to be diagnosed with autism by a professional. To anyone that holds any familiarty with me, the knee-jerk reaction should be: "This is obviously an undiagnosed autistic man"</p1>
<p2>To me, this is not so obvious. Maybe it's something I can atrribute to my complete lack of ability for self-evaluation, or repressing awkward childhood memories of being at a child shrink, being asked what the meaning of certain words were, to gauge where my intelligence was at</p2> 
<p3>My mom pretty persistently suggested I had some sort of asperger's (Which is an antiquated categorization of autism), which I found upsetting. In hindsight, she probably had every right to assume that.</p3>
<p4>This train of thought arrived the station when I saw something about "toe walking", being a dead giveaway for a child being autstic. I loved walking on my toes as a kid. It was a combination of not wanting to wake my mom or grandparents up, when I got up like 5 in the morning to watch TV without sound on, and also just feeling like a werewolf.</p4>
  <p5>My favorite Yu-Gi-Oh card as a kid was "Lycanthrope", a Ritual Monster that gets a higher attack value based on how many Normal Monsters are in the Graveyard. It's part of many awful strategies, and it is pretty bad by itself, but who's right is it, to label anyone as "Normal" or "Abnormal"?</p5>
  <p6>That's the worst thing the card suggests. To make some sort of Dichotomy, between "Normal"- and "Effect" Monsters, suggesting that allistic people are plain and autistic people hold some special traits</p6>
  <p7>I should probably get diagnosed.</p7>

<h3>First Entry</h3>
<p1>Last week (Around the 22nd of January), I bought a trumpet, because I had been listening to so much of Chet Baker's music (I almost wrote Chet Hanks, lol) I'm not very fond of his music, I don't know what my issue with it is, but it's been on repeat nonetheless.</p1> 
<p2>Maybe I'm wrong about how I feel. I think it might be primarily his voice that i find to be an indignation. He has a beautiful voice, don't get me wrong-- I just am immediately reminded by so many lazy and untalented singers trying to replicate his voice, whether it's in music classes I had as a kid, or participating in the music scene of where I live. It's almost like an impression. The key difference is that after Chet ends his crooning, he can break into a beautiful trumpet arrangement.</p2>
  <p3>I wanted to adapt this into my playing repertoir, but after only a day of playing the trumpet, one of the valves got stuck. Or rather, the screw that holds it in place. </p3>
I tried forcing it out, and I broke one of the braces. I'm not very graceful with things that require a lot of care, and I thought the brass instrument would sustain my bruteforcings, but alas! It is now stowed away for potentially rest of eternity. Yet still, I wanted to diversify my musical portofolio, so I have been preoccupied in finding weird and alternate tunings, and feverishly trying to replicate riffs from 'Hold Your Horse is' by ear. It's not an easy task, but I'm hoping it'll improve the trite and boring music I have been writing the last year. I don't know, sometimes it feels like you strike a big vein of gold, and it gushes out unendingly, and then there's a drought. My vein is still gushing, but it's not gold, it's just shit. Endless amounts of boring, uninspired crap. The drummer in my new band complained the songs were sleep-inducing. In a joking tone of course, but he had a point. So hopefully soon, although I won't be breaking into a trumpet solo on account of a broken brace, I will potentially be able to incorporate the fibonacci sequence IRONICALLY into my playing.

  <p2>I wanted this to serve as a combination of an "About me"-page, and blog of sorts. </p2>

<h2>First Entry</h2>
</body>
<p1>Last week (Around the 22nd of January), I bought a trumpet, because I had been listening to so much of Chet Baker's music (I almost wrote Chet Hanks, lol) I'm not very fond of his music, I don't know what my issue with it is, but it's been on repeat nonetheless.</p1> 
<p2>Maybe I'm wrong about how I feel. I think it might be primarily his voice that i find to be an indignation. He has a beautiful voice, don't get me wrong-- I just am immediately reminded by so many lazy and untalented singers trying to replicate his voice, whether it's in music classes I had as a kid, or participating in the music scene of where I live. It's almost like an impression. The key difference is that after Chet ends his crooning, he can break into a beautiful trumpet arrangement.</p2>
  <p3>I wanted to adapt this into my playing repertoir, but after only a day of playing the trumpet, one of the valves got stuck. Or rather, the screw that holds it in place. </p3>
I tried forcing it out, and I broke one of the braces. I'm not very graceful with things that require a lot of care, and I thought the brass instrument would sustain my bruteforcings, but alas! It is now stowed away for potentially rest of eternity. Yet still, I wanted to diversify my musical portofolio, so I have been preoccupied in finding weird and alternate tunings, and feverishly trying to replicate riffs from 'Hold Your Horse is' by ear. It's not an easy task, but I'm hoping it'll improve the trite and boring music I have been writing the last year. I don't know, sometimes it feels like you strike a big vein of gold, and it gushes out unendingly, and then there's a drought. My vein is still gushing, but it's not gold, it's just shit. Endless amounts of boring, uninspired crap. The drummer in my new band complained the songs were sleep-inducing. In a joking tone of course, but he had a point. So hopefully soon, although I won't be breaking into a trumpet solo on account of a broken brace, but I will potentially be able to incorporate the fibonacci sequence but IRONICALLY into my playing.
